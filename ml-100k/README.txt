#Hey Clinton,
#So, I have not finished the assignment again. I was mainly able to get step 1,
#and make some headway into the other steps. I put about 15 hours into this assignment
#, and realize I should have put in 25 or 30. I think I have an ok framework,
#but I ran into some problems that I'd like to run through
#with you at some point this week, if they aren't addressed in the HW run-through
#tomorrow. This seems to be a pattern, which I hope that it won't become. I'm
#learning a ton, and really enjoying the class. Though I'm finding it very challenging,
# I'm very motivated to be here, and as long as you aren't worried, I'm not.
# Let me know of your concerns though if you have any.
# Thanks,
# Will

#For working code, run the movie_load.py file. Feel free to check through the
#other files as well for progress. I also tested mainly using print statements.
I know that I'm using that as a crutch, and need to be writing more robust tests.
