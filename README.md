Run the movie_UI.py file to get movie recommendations. Your options for movie recommendations are:
1. Top movies based on 100,000 user ratings
2. Popular movies that you haven't seen
3. Movies recommended for you based on similar users
4. Movies similar to a movie you enjoyed
5. Movie recommendations within a particular genre
6. Movies that users near you enjoyed

data_handling.py reads in all of the data from the appropriate files and defines the Movie class.
