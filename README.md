# Movie Recommendations

## Description

Use the MovieLens data to recommend movies to users.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Use the `csv` module to read files
* Use list comprehensions to filter data and perform calculations
* Model a problem using objects and functions

## Details

* A Git repo called `movie-recommendations` containing at least:
  * `README.md` file explaining how to run your project
  * modules for your program
  * tests for your program

## Normal Mode

First, go to the [MovieLens website](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
and download the MovieLens 100K data. Unzip it and read the `README` file
to understand the data.

Your goal is going to be to write a system that will recommend movies to a
user.

### Step 1

You need to be able to load in movie and rating data. Using the `csv` module,
write a module that will load in the movie data from `u.item` and the rating
data from `u.info`. You can choose how you will store movies and ratings, but
you will need to be able to associate them later.

Specifically, you will need to be able to:

* Find all ratings for a movie by id
* Find the average rating for a movie by id
* Find the name of a movie by id
* Find all ratings for a user

### Step 2

The easiest way to recommend movies is to recommend the most popular movies.
Write a program to show the top X movies by average rating with their rating.
You need to be able to state a minimum number of ratings for a movie to be
considered.

Now, create the ability to find the top X movies by average rating that _a
specific user has not rated_. This allows you to suggest popular movies for
a specific user.

### Step 3

Popular movies are not really good enough on their own. What would be great
is a way to match two users by their tastes. You need to create the ability
to take two users and find their similarity. There's a few ways to do this.
We'll focus on the _Euclidean distance_. If you have a list of movie
ratings for user 1 (_v_) and a list for user 2 (_w_), where each list
is made up of ratings for movies they've both seen in the same order, then
you can use this formula:

```py
def euclidean_distance(v, w):
    """Given two lists, give the Euclidean distance between them on a scale
    of 0 to 1. 1 means the two lists are identical.
    """

    # Guard against empty lists.
    if len(v) is 0:
        return 0

    # Note that this is the same as vector subtraction.
    differences = [v[idx] - w[idx] for idx in range(len(v))]
    squares = [diff ** 2 for diff in differences]
    sum_of_squares = sum(squares)

    return 1 / (1 + math.sqrt(sum_of_squares))
```

You may want to look up the _Pearson correlation score_. This is more
complicated, but accounts for people with different grading scales (for
example, I may never rate movies above 4 because I am grumpy, but our
relative scoring may be similar.)

### Step 4

Now that you can calculate the similarity between two users, add a new
ability. Given a list of all users, find the users most similar to a
specific user, and then recommend the highest rated movies from those
users that the specific user hasn't seen.

A good formula for figuring out movies that user might like the most
is `similarity * rating`.

### Step 5

Put this all together! The interface is up to you. You may want to
have one program that presents a menu system so you can see top
overall movies, popular movies you haven't seen (you'll have to give
your user id), or recommendations specific to you.

Another option would be a command-line program that takes arguments
on the command line. Look at the `argparse` library for this. You might
make multiple programs, like so:

* `popular_movies.py` -- returns a table of popular movies, takes a user_id
   argument to filter out movies that user has seen
* `recommendations.py` -- returns a table of recommended movies for a user

## Hard Mode

In addition to all of the above:

* Look up the _Pearson correlation score_ and implement it as well as
Euclidean distance. Try both and find out which gives you better results.
* We currently recommend movies by finding similar users. Turn your data around
to find similar movies based on their reviews from users. Add the ability to
choose a movie by id and see the movies that are most like it and most not like
it.
* Try out your program with the MovieLens 1M dataset.
* Think of something new and try it out! There's a lot of data that comes with
MovieLens.
